# Movie-Recommendation-System
 # Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** designed to provide personalized movie suggestions to users by leveraging collaborative and content-based filtering techniques. It demonstrates the application of machine learning and data analysis in solving real-world recommendation problems.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Predicts user preferences based on the behavior and preferences of similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies with characteristics similar to those the user has interacted with.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both filtering methods for improved recommendation accuracy.
- **Data Processing**: Utilizes advanced data preprocessing techniques to clean and transform the dataset.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assesses model performance using metrics like RMSE and Precision@K.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): For data manipulation and analysis.
  - [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/): For implementing machine learning algorithms.
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): For numerical computations.

## Dataset

The project uses a public dataset sourced from [GitHub](https://github.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset/raw/main/Movies%20Recommendation.csv). This dataset includes user ratings and movie information, making it suitable for building a recommendation system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/SUDARSHANJADHAV2/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Movie-Recommendation-System
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script to generate recommendations:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Follow the prompts to input user preferences and view movie recommendations.
